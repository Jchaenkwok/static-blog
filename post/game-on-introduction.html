Growing up, I spent countless hours playing video games, from <em>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2 on the PS2</em> to <em>Pokémon Platinum</em> on the Nintendo DS, and then <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>CS:GO</em> on my PC. As I got older, my fascination with video games never waned, but I found myself trying to analyze and understand the intricacies and differences between games.  I began studying computer science in college, but it wasn&#x27;t until recently that I decided to fully commit to learning the ins and outs of game development.</p><p class="mb-8">I was watching the anime <em>Overlord</em> with one of my friends and at the start of the show, the main character is playing Yggdrasil - a game where your brain is plugged into the console and you experience everything. I jokingly told my friend, &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be cool to make something like that?&quot; But the thought was still there when I woke up the following day.</p><p class="mb-8">As I started to dig into game development, I decided to use Unreal Engine as my primary tool to learn. Unreal Engine is a powerful game engine that has been used to create some of the most popular games in gaming history, including the Batman: Arkham series, Fortnite, and Valorant. Part of the reason was that I&#x27;m choosing it is because I&#x27;ve dabbled with Blueprint, Unreal&#x27;s visual scripting system in the past.</p><p class="mb-8">While I&#x27;ve worked with programming languages like Java, Python, and C before, I&#x27;ve never needed to learn C++. Since creating games using Unreal Engine is done with C++, this will be a great opportunity for me to dive deeper into the language and understand how it is different compared to what I know. I&#x27;m excited to expand my skill set and see it reflected in the projects I create. </p><p class="mb-8">Through this blog, I aim to document my progress as I dive into the world of game design and development. I&#x27;ll be sharing my experiences, challenges, and milestones along the way, as well as any resources and insights I discover. I hope to not only improve my skills but also inspire and encourage others who share my passion for gaming.</p><p class="mb-8">So whether you&#x27;re a seasoned game developer, a curious gamer, or a newbie just like me, I invite you to join me on this exciting journey. Stay tuned for updates as I begin to explore and experiment with Unreal Engine and together, let&#x27;s level up our skills and create something amazing!</p></div></div><div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-8 pb-12 mb-8"><h3 class="text-xl mb-8 font-semibold border-b pb-4">Leave a Reply</h3><div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 mb-4"><textarea class="p-4 outline-none w-full rounded-lg h-40 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-gray-200 bg-gray-100 text-gray-700" name="comment" placeholder="Comment"></textarea></div><div class="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mb-4"><input type="text" class="py-2 px-4 outline-none w-full rounded-lg focus:ring-2 focus:ring-gray-200 bg-gray-100 text-gray-700" placeholder="Name" name="name"/><input type="email" class="py-2 px-4 outline-none w-full rounded-lg focus:ring-2 focus:ring-gray-200 bg-gray-100 text-gray-700" placeholder="Email" name="email"/></div><div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 mb-4"><div><input type="checkbox" id="storeData" name="storeData" value="true"/><label class="text-gray-500 cursor-pointer" for="storeData"> Save my name, email in this browser for the next time I comment.</label></div></div><div class="mt-8"><button type="button" class="transition duration-500 ease hover:bg-indigo-900 inline-block bg-blue-600 text-lg font-medium rounded-full text-white px-8 py-3 cursor-pointer">Post Comment</button></div></div></div><div class="col-span-1 lg:col-span-4"><div class="relative lg:sticky top-8"><div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-8 mb-8"><h3 class="text-xl mb-8 font-semibold border-b pb-4"> <!-- -->Related Posts<!-- --> </h3></div><div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-8 mb-8"><h3 class="text-xl mb-4 font-semibold border-b pb-4"> Tags </h3></div></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Game On! | Let the Game Begin","excerpt":"An introduction to my new blog.
